1. Types of Cloud Based on Deployment

These define where the cloud is hosted and who controls it:

Public Cloud

Owned and operated by third-party providers (like AWS, Azure, GCP).

Resources (servers, storage, networking) are shared among multiple customers.

Cost-effective, scalable, but less control.
âœ… Example: AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.

Private Cloud

Dedicated infrastructure for one organization.

Can be hosted on-premises or by a third party.

More security, customization, and control.
âœ… Example: VMware, OpenStack, AWS Outposts.

Hybrid Cloud

Combination of public + private clouds, connected for flexibility.

Workloads can move between environments.
âœ… Example: A company stores sensitive data in a private cloud but uses public cloud for scalability.

Multi-Cloud

Using multiple public cloud providers simultaneously (AWS + Azure + GCP).

Avoids vendor lock-in and improves resilience.
âœ… Example: Running databases on AWS but analytics on GCP.

Community Cloud

Shared by multiple organizations with common goals (e.g., government, healthcare).

Costs and infrastructure are shared.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Types of Cloud Based on Service Models

These define what services the cloud provides:

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

Provides virtualized computing resources (servers, storage, networking).

You manage OS, applications; provider manages infrastructure.
âœ… Example: AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine.

PaaS (Platform as a Service)

Provides a platform for application development and deployment.

You manage applications; provider manages OS, runtime, and infrastructure.
âœ… Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Azure App Service.

SaaS (Software as a Service)

Fully managed applications delivered over the internet.

Users just consume the software, no infrastructure or platform management.
âœ… Example: Gmail, Office 365, Salesforce, Zoom.

FaaS / Serverless Computing

Run code in response to events without managing servers.

Pay only for execution time.
âœ… Example: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions.

âœ¨ In short:

Deployment types = Public, Private, Hybrid, Multi-Cloud, Community

Service models = IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, FaaS
